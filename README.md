Welcome! I'm **Joseph Leto**, a cloud engineer who codes between poker shifts. This repository contains the source for my interactive terminal portfolio at [josephaleto.io](https://josephaleto.io). 

**What makes this different?** Every command you run on the site executes live Lambda code deployed through Terraform and GitHub Actions. It's not just a resume‚Äîit's a working demonstration of modern cloud architecture.

This project showcases my skills in cloud engineering, infrastructure as code, and automated deployment pipelines.

## Try It Yourself

üëâ Head over to [https://josephaleto.io](https://josephaleto.io) and type `help` in the terminal. From there you can explore commands like `resume`, `stack`, `architecture`, or even `offer` to send me your details.

## The Story Behind This Project

This started as the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)‚Äîa project to build a resume website using cloud technologies. But I wanted to go beyond a static page.

**My approach:** Build a fully interactive terminal experience where visitors can explore my skills through actual commands. Each command you type executes real Lambda functions that interact with live AWS resources. No mock-ups, no demos‚Äîjust working cloud infrastructure.

---

## Architecture Overview

**Frontend:**
- **S3** hosts the static website files
- **CloudFront** provides global content distribution
- **Route 53** manages DNS routing

**Backend:**
- **API Gateway** receives terminal commands
- **Lambda** processes commands and game logic
- **DynamoDB** stores visitor data and game states

**DevOps:**
- **Terraform** manages all infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** automates testing and deployment

**The workflow:** Push to `main` ‚Üí GitHub Actions builds and tests ‚Üí Lambda deploys ‚Üí S3 syncs ‚Üí Site updates. It's the same CI/CD process I use for production systems.

## What You Can Do

- **Interactive Terminal** ‚Äî Full bash-like experience with command history and tab completion
- **Explore Commands** ‚Äî Type `help` to see all available commands
- **View Architecture** ‚Äî See the live infrastructure with `stack` command
- **Play Blackjack** ‚Äî Full-featured casino game with real game logic
- **Contact Me** ‚Äî Use `offer` to send your details via Zapier integration
- **Track Analytics** ‚Äî Visitor counter stored in DynamoDB

---

## Technologies Used

- **React & JavaScript** for the terminal UI
- **AWS** ‚Äî S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Route¬†53
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
