This site is a proof-of-work portfolio powered by real AWS services. Every terminal command runs live infrastructure that I built with Terraform and deploy through GitHub Actions.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates not just theoretical knowledge but working, production-grade DevOps. It reflects:

- Strong understanding of cloud architecture
- Ability to automate infrastructure and deployments
- Clean, responsive front-end integration
- Reliable, testable, and scalable system design

This isn't just a static resume siteâ€”it's a fully integrated DevOps pipeline. From CI/CD to serverless backend logic and DNS routing, every piece of this infrastructure mirrors how modern cloud-native applications are built and maintained in the real world.

Recruiters and engineers can quickly assess practical skills and real-world decision-making.
